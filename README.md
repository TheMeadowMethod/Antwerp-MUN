# Antwerp Model United Nations
As the only major student city in Belgium without its own MUN simulation, the concept was
introduced in 2012 at the initiative of Bart Sips, then a student at the University of Antwerp,
with the support of several Antwerp student associations. The very first edition proved to be
a great success, resonating strongly with Antwerp students and giving the young project a
tremendous boost. Encouraged by the growing demand and interest, AntwerpMUN decided
to take things a step further.

Under the initiative of former president and current advisor, Mr. Sina Asghari, a professional
non-profit organization was established to bring the culture of negotiation and debate closer
to students. The new association was officially recognized by the University of Antwerp and
also functions as a faculty circle for the Faculties of Law, Business and Economics, and
Social Sciences.

This recognition attracted a wide range of partners, allowing the association to gain
international visibility and to launch new initiatives, projects, and events. One notable
example is the “ScholierenMUN” simulations, where we organize UN simulations for
secondary school students. Each year, we proudly continue this positive trend of growth and
innovation.

##Antwerp MUN passport
At AntwerpMUN, we believe that every experience counts. That’s why we created the MUN Passport
– a personal record of your journey with us.
The Passport is more than just a keepsake: it is a CV-worthy certificate of engagement. For each
event you attend – from workshops and lectures to receptions and simulations – you receive an
official stamp as proof of participation. Over time, your Passport becomes a tangible record of your
dedication and growth.
But it doesn’t stop there. The MUN Passport is also a networking tool. You can note down the contact
details of the people you meet, making it easy to reconnect later. It also offers space to reflect: jot
down what you learned, the ideas that stuck with you, or simply what you enjoyed most about the
event.
In short, the AntwerpMUN Passport is designed to help you track your development, expand your
network, and showcase your commitment to future employers.
Collect your stamps. Grow your network. Build your future.

##history

##mission and vision
AntwerpMUN is a professional student association dedicated to simulating the work of the
United Nations and other multilateral organizations, designed specifically for and by students
of diplomacy, law, international politics, and economics. As the Antwerp chapter, we
represent the international M.U.N. concept, which is officially recognized by the United
Nations under Resolution 77/336. This places us among leading academic hubs such as
New York, Cambridge, Rome, Istanbul, Vancouver, New Delhi, London, Paris, and Leiden.

The M.U.N. concept involves organizing a variety of academic events throughout the year,
including simulations, debates, lectures, workshops, and career fairs. These activities
connect our students with business leaders, diplomats, judges, and other professionals,
offering valuable opportunities to build networks for their future careers.

AntwerpMUN is best known for its prestigious three-day UN simulation, held in the second
semester. During this event, participants step into the role of ambassadors, representing a
country of their choice and debating pressing global issues. Topics range from conflict
situations, such as civil wars, to challenges like climate change and social inequality. This
flagship event consistently attracts many enthusiastic participants and is widely regarded as
a geat success.

Why the Partnership Between EF and AntwerpMUN Matters
At its core, both EF and AntwerpMUN share the same vision: empowering young people to
engage with the world through knowledge, dialogue, and cultural exchange. While
AntwerpMUN focuses on simulating the work of the United Nations and introducing students
to the art of diplomacy, negotiation, and debate, EF has a long-standing tradition of breaking
down barriers through language, education, and international experiences.

The partnership between EF and AntwerpMUN is therefore a natural fit. In Model United
Nations, students are challenged to understand different perspectives, represent cultures
other than their own, and find common ground on pressing global issues. EF complements
this mission by equipping students with the linguistic and intercultural skills they need to
thrive in such environments. Together, we not only prepare students for an academic
simulation, but also for a future in which global awareness and cross-cultural understanding
are essential.

This collaboration also carries a symbolic value: AntwerpMUN positions Antwerp alongside
leading academic cities worldwide, and EF opens the door for students to experience those
cities firsthand through study and exchange programs. It is a bridge between simulation and
reality—between classroom debate and real-world diplomacy.

By working together, EF and AntwerpMUN create an ecosystem where students can practice
global citizenship in theory, in dialogue, and in lived experience. It is this combination of
academic rigor, intercultural exchange, and professional development that makes our
collaboration not only relevant, but truly transformative.
